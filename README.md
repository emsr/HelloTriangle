This is me following the Vulkan tutorial: https://vulkan-tutorial.com

I'm taking some liberties with formatting.

The idea is to have something that could start an application.

The stuff in 3rdpart are required to load graphics content. They are excellent and convenient single-header libraries:
  - stb_image.h is from a collection of single-header libs (you only need the one): https://github.com/nothings/stb.git
  - tiny_obj_loader.h is from https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader.git
